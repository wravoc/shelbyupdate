Still a [great template](https://creativemarket.com/Bruk/70522-Shelby-One-Page-HTML5-Template) in 2023. The following needs to be updated.

## jQuery

index.html *Original* 

<script src='https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.4/jquery.min.js'></script> 

*Updated*

<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.6.3.min.js" integrity="sha256-pvPw+upLPUjgMXY0G+8O0xUf+/Im1MZjXxxgOcBQBXU=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

## Featherlight jQuery Lightbox Library

(Now with image gallery!)
[Download the new files](https://noelboss.github.io/featherlight/)
Copy new .js and .css files into appropriate folders, delete older versions, update links
Open styles.css and delete the rule called /* Back text */

## FontAwesome.com

Download and replace files
Find & replace 'fa ' with 'fa-solid' everywhere except social media buttons
Social Media buttons like dribbble and behance find & replace with 'fa-brands'
Replace 'fa-envelope-o' with 'fa-envelope-open'

## Favico

Replace old <!-- Favicon --> with the code generated from https://favicon.io/ which will include the new version of Chrome and iPad Favicons.

Enjoy!
